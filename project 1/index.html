        <p id="para1">Vikings were seafaring Norse people from Scandinavia, active from the late 8th to early 11th centuries, known for their exploration, trade, and raids across Europe. Renowned for their advanced shipbuilding techniques, they navigated vast distances, reaching as far as North America, the Mediterranean, and Central Asia. Viking society was complex, with a rich cultural heritage that included distinctive art, mythology, and legal systems. Despite their reputation as fierce warriors, they were also skilled traders and settlers, establishing colonies in places like Iceland, Greenland, and Normandy. The Viking Age left a significant legacy, influencing the cultural and historical development of Europe.</p>
